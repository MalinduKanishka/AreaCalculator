1. I have only taken 90 minutes to complete this task.

2. Used Command Line Application because another option I had was using the web app, I did not want to use Angular for the front end because we are required to use only c#.

3. Most important thing is unit testing, exercises did not ask us to use unit testing, however, I have used extremely light 3-unit test cases. I was not sure to do the main algorithm unit test because i wanted to finish this with 90 minutes.
